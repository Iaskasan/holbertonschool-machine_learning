    """
    Calculates the cost of a neural network with L2 regularization

    Parameters
    ----------
    cost : float
        The cost of the network without L2 regularization (e.g. cross-entropy).
    lambtha : float
        The regularization parameter (Î»), controls the strength of the penalty.
    weights : dict
        Dictionary of weights and biases of the neural network.
        Keys look like 'W1', 'b1', 'W2', 'b2', ... up to layer L.
    L : int
        Number of layers in the neural network.
    m : int
        Number of training examples.

    Returns
    -------
    float
        The cost of the network accounting for L2 regularization.
